## Affine Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi Tracker

C++ implementation of Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) feature tracking including affine transformation estimation.  The OpenCV implementation doesn't provide the affine transformations, which is why I wrote this code.  Implementation is based on the [technical report by Bouguet](http://robots.stanford.edu/cs223b04/algo_tracking.pdf).
